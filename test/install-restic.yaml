# Description: Ansible tasks to install restic on a Linux system.
# This tasks file:
#   1. Ensures the target binary directory (bin_path) exists.
#   2. Checks if restic is already installed by running its version command.
#   3. Extracts the version string from the output.
#   4. Sets a fact (restic_installed) if the binary exists and its version matches the desired setup_restic_version.
#   5. Downloads and installs restic from GitHub if not installed or if the version is incorrect.
#   6. Sets the fact (restic_cmd) with the full path to the restic binary.
#   7. Displays a debug message showing the restic binary path.
#
# Variables required:
#   - bin_path: the directory where restic should be installed (e.g., "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/bin")
#   - setup_restic_version: the desired version string (e.g., "0.17.3")
#
# To run only these tasks, use the tag 'install-restic':
#   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini your_playbook.yaml --tags install-restic
